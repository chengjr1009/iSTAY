Description: Provides functions to to compute a continuum of information-based measures 
 for quantifying the temporal stability of populations, communities, and ecosystems, 
 as well as their associated synchrony, based on species (or species assemblage)
 biomass or other key variables. When biodiversity data are available, the package
 also enables the assessment of the corresponding diversityâ€“stability relationships.
 All measures are applicable in both temporal and spatial contexts.
